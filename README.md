# Big Sales Prediction using Random Forest Regressor

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting sales for large datasets using a Random Forest Regressor. By leveraging this ensemble learning method, we aim to build a robust model that accurately forecasts sales based on historical data.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions and correlations.
- **Model Building**: Implementing a Random Forest Regressor with scikit-learn.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing the model with Grid Search and Random Search.
- **Deployment**: Preparing the model for real-world deployment.
